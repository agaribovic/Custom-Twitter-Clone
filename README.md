**Custom Twitter Clone**

**Custom Twitter Clone** is a side project I developed using the **MERN stack â€” MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js**. The project was initially inspired by Twitterâ€™s style and core functionalities but has evolved with many additional, custom features beyond Twitterâ€™s scope. It was also created as a guide to help a group of students learn full-stack web development.

**Features**

The app combines frontend and backend functionalities with the following features:

User authentication: **Login and Registration**

Tweets: **Create, read, update, delete, search, sort, and like**

Users can **edit, delete, and like only their own tweets;** other usersâ€™ tweets are protected

**Admin privileges:** modify all tweets and delete users

Social features: **Follow, unfollow, and shuffle users**

**Dark and light mode toggle**

**Live chat** between users via **WebSockets**

**Background music:** play and stop at will

**LocalStorage** for auth tokens; all other data stored in the database

Ready to be deployed on **AWS** or **Microsoft Azure**

## ðŸ›  Installation Instructions
